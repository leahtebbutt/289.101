        <h2> Who is LeMaker </h2>
        <p>
          Sophie Lemaire-Sicre, originally from Queenstown, has spent the past three years studying at Massey University and now calls Wellington home. Choosing a major in Industrial Design, it is clear that Sophie has a passion for creating things with her hands and she has done so through various projects.
          <br><br>
          At just twenty years of age she has seen many successes in her work, from having her Nib Feeders stocked in local Wellington stores to having her work showcased at Milan Design Week. No doubt these successes will continue for this young aspiring designer.
          <br><br>
          Sophie has established an Etsy store which sells her products or you can visit Magnolia Trading Company where her Nib Bird Feeders are being stocked. She has both an Instagram and email where you can get in touch with her.

          <h4> Night Light </h4>
          <p> Children's night light designed to easily be transported throughout the night with either its top pop up handle or base grip. It is clinically proven that red light is the colour least likely to interfere with a child's melatonin levels while asleep, this design allows the child to have a constant reference light in the base to help find the light yet still gain a peaceful nights sleep.</p>

          <h4> Salt and Pepper Mill </h4>
          <p> Salt and pepper mill/grinder product design. Inspired by stone age tools. The tetxured surface blends with the hand for a firm grip. </p>
        </li>

        <li>
          <img src="images/dotastool.jpg" width="300" height="400" alt="#" />
          <h4> Dota <h4>
            <p> Influenced by 50's and 60's furniture Dota lends itself to the elegant, effortless design of this era. Focusing on the simplicity of structure particularly in the legs and seat top. Dota finds its beauty in the subtle details; sharp lines and smooth curves. Its form allows its function to extend far beyond just a stool. Made from American ash and lovingly finished, Dota takes the ancient techniques of a wedged tenon joint used to fix axe heads to the handles and applies it to an equally ancient furniture piece.</p>

    <p> The bird feeders - or Nib feeders as Sophie calls them - were a part of a design project that she presented for her degree programme last year. The brief was to design a vessel to be a part of a koha (a maori term meaning donation or contribution) exhibition where by all of the pieces made were given away on the day.</p>

    <br><br>
    <p> It was a tricky assignment for Sophie as there was a certain focus of adding value to an object without the use of expensive materials. Sophie approached Wellington-based potter, Sue Dasler, to help fire the pieces for her. The Nib Feeders are created with a two part mould. This particular design is for smaller birds, like sparrows and finches. </p>
